- [x] I have a 3D printer or will be getting one before March 21st

My Goals:
- 1. Use entirely off-the-shelf components for all non-printed parts.
- 2. Run Klipper Firmware
- 3. Cost under $300 USD other than fillament costs/ stuff I already own.
- 4. Be no larger than 300mm x 300mm x 400mm
- 5. Be portable and easy to move.
- 5. All 3D Printed parts will be printable on a Ender 3 V3 SE.

## Day 1: 2/17/2025
I am just starting this project. I am currently researching other open source 3D Printers to see what design I want.
